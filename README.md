## Real Estate Tokenization with Smart Contracts

This project demonstrates a simple decentralized application (DApp) for managing real estate agreements using blockchain technology. It includes two smart contracts: `RealEstateAgreement.sol` and `RealEstateTok.sol`. Additionally, there is a single HTML file (`index.html`) that incorporates CSS and JavaScript for the user interface.

### Prerequisites

Before running the DApp, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. [Metamask Extension](https://metamask.io/) for your web browser.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the Real Estate DApp on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository to your local system.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahuldj2/DTU-WEB3.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder in [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred code editor.

3. Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VSCode if you haven't already. This extension allows you to run the HTML file locally.

4. Launch the HTML file using Live Server:
   - Right-click on `index.html` in VSCode.
   - Select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.

   This will open the DApp in your default web browser.

5. In the DApp, you will be prompted to connect your wallet. Click the "Connect Wallet" button.

6. Ensure that you have the Metamask extension installed in your browser. If not, you can download it from [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).

### Deploying Smart Contracts

The smart contracts, `RealEstateAgreement.sol` and `RealEstateTok.sol`, have already been deployed to the Sepolia testnet. You can interact with these contracts through the DApp once you have connected your Metamask wallet.

### Usage

Once you have successfully launched the DApp and connected your wallet, you can use it to:

- Create and manage real estate agreements.
- Transfer and trade real estate tokens.
- In the field address and token_id put the following for testing
-address field="0x454C0E00718bc00979f549ea8f0D1C4532C5C853"
-tokenID=305
Everytime you test the application use a different tokenID.
